# Payment Channel
### Completed Work
- Have already successfully test Raiden in test netwok --ropsten
- Have already realized ERC20 token transaction in test network --ropsten 
- Finish python script for different scenario(Open/Close/Pay/Deposit)

### TO Do 
- Deploy it in our private chain.

## Issue
1. Raiden Network is used to solve scalbility for Ethereum. However, since we have used POA to be our private chain, the scalbility problem will be mitigated.
2. This opensource is still in development, so it's so risk for us to use it in market
3. There are still many bug haven't been fixed by official
